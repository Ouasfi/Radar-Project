# Radar detection problem
The subject deals with the following issue: How to choose for a radar the power of its transmitted signal and its detection threshold to guarantee a given false alarm probability and a given correct detection probability? To answer this question, the chosen path consists in comparing the complex amplitude of the received signal with the threshold T.
